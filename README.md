# Student Management System

## Description

The **Student Management System** is a Java-based application designed to manage student records efficiently. This system allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on student data stored in a MySQL database. The project is implemented using Java, MySQL, and JDBC for database connectivity.

## Features

- Add new student records
- View all students
- Update existing student details
- Delete student records
- Search for students by ID or name

## Technologies Used

- **Java** (Core Java, JDBC)
- **MySQL** (Database Management System)
- **JDBC** (Java Database Connectivity)
- **Eclipse IDE** (Development Environment)

## Future Enhancements

- Implement a **frontend** using **React.js** or **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** for better user experience.
- Add **Spring Boot** for enhanced backend functionality.
- Integrate RESTful APIs for better scalability.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

1. Install **Java JDK (Version 8 or later)**
2. Install **MySQL Server** and configure a database
3. Install **Eclipse IDE**

### Database Setup

1. Open MySQL and create a database:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE student_management;

2. Create a table:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE students (
       id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
       name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
       age INT NOT NULL,
       course VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
   );
   ```
3. Insert sample data (optional):
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO students (name, age, course) VALUES ('Ravi chandra', 23, 'Full Stack Java Development');
   ```

### Running the Application

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/student-management-system.git
   ```
2. Open the project in **Eclipse IDE**.
3. Configure the MySQL JDBC driver.
